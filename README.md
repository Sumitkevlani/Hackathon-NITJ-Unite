Tech Stack : 
Currently we have designed a prototype on figma. In future, we are going to build the frontend with the help
of React JS, Material UI whereas we have decided to build the backend with the help of Firebase.

Problem Statement : 
As we know there is a lack of peer-to-peer communication in every college. Every fresher
who joins college faces a lot of difficulty and there is a lack of proper guidance. And for every student it
is a problem that the students who grab good placements and the alumnis are in less contact with the students.
We want to provide the profit of college alumnis to the students of that college and a platform where every member can communicate in a professional manner and post their achievements and get an opportunity of referral from seniors.

Solution :
We have made a platform called "NITJ-Unite" where only the college students can login by their institute email id and we are going to make a different login system for college alumnis. A platform where every student
can communicate and take guidance from every senior may be of any branch and of any year. We have made separate collections for every department and academic years so that juniors find it easy to communicate with seniors. Every person has their own profile section where they are being rated on the basis of their programming, development and other skills and that will be displayed on their respective profile rating section which ultimately helps them to grab referrals.
Seniors can help their juniors in their respective projects in any field which helps the juniors and the rating of seniors will be increased on the basis of feedback of the juniors.

Others:
We got this idea by our first year journey in which we were new to the IT field and we had no knowledge about 
this domain. At that time, we felt that there is a lack of guidance and we faced a lot of difficulties in communicating and taking guidance. That's why we come up with this idea.
